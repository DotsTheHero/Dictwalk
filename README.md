# Dictwalk
Given a dictionary, and 2 words, this utilizes A* to find a path between the two words. Generally if it's possible, it finds the solution within a few seconds at most, but if it's not possible it can spend a very long time exhaustively checking to ensure that a solution is not in fact possible.
By default it comes equipped with a Scrabble dictionary of nearly 200,000 words. If you want to use it with your own dictionary, just have a .txt named dictionary.txt in the same folder as it when you run it. There is no need for the dictionary to be in alphabetical order.
